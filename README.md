Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python
# *Overview.

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Implementation project! This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the classic Caesar cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Developed as part of an internship project at Prodigy Infotech, this project aims to demonstrate the fundamental principles of encryption and decryption, offering a practical introduction to the world of cryptography.

# *Project Description

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For instance, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This project provides a complete implementation of the Caesar cipher, including both encryption and decryption functionalities.

# *Features

-Encryption: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting characters a fixed number of positions.

-Decryption: Revert ciphertext back to plaintext by reversing the character shift.

-Custom Shift Values: Allow users to specify the number of positions each character is shifted.

-Case Sensitivity: Maintain the case of the original text, ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase letters are correctly shifted.

-Non-alphabetic Characters: Preserve spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphabetic characters in the text without alteration.

# *Usage

To use this Caesar cipher implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher-python.git

cd caesar-cipher-python

2.Run the Script:

python caesar_cipher.py

3. Input Text:

(i)Enter the text you wish to encrypt or decrypt.

(ii)Specify the shift value.

(iii)Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the input text.

# *Example
--Encrypting the message "Hello, World!" with a shift of 3:

Original:  Hello, World!

Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!

--Decrypting the message "Khoor, Zruog!" with a shift of 3:

Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!

Decrypted: Hello, World!
